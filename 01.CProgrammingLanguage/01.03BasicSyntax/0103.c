    Tokens The smallest unit of a source code in C is called as token.
    
    C language can be classified into six types of tokens based on the functions they are used to perform.
    The types of C tokens are as follows :

        - Keywords
        - Identifiers
        - Constants
        - Strings
        - Special Symbols
        - Operators


    Identifiers : Used to identify a variable, function or any other user-defined item.

    Certain rules should be followed while naming c identifiers which are as follows :

        - They must consist of only letters, digits, or underscore.
        - Other special characters are not allowed.
        - It should not be a keyword of the language.
        - It must not contain white space.
        - It should be discriptive.
