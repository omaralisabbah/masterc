    01 C Programming Language: 04 Naming Rules

    Bad practices in variable naming conventions can significantly reduce code readability,
    maintainability, and increase the likelihood of errors.
    
    Here are some common bad practices to avoid:
    - Using generic or ambiguous names
    - Inconsistent naming conventions
    - Overusing abbreviations or single-letter variables
    - Ignoring context and scope
    - Embedding type information in names
    - Using misleading or confusing names


    Naming Conventions in Programming : (Search about it)

    Among all sorts of conventions, naming conventions are some of the most common. Because as programmers,
    we name a lot of things. Such as variables, functions, classes, methods, interfaces and so on.
    
    Throughout the years, developers have used different case types to name different entities in their code.
    And four of them have proved to be the most popular ones.
    They are :

    [1] camelCase :
        - Examples of camel case : firstName and lastName.

    [2] snake_case :
        - Examples of snake case : first_name and last_name.

    [3] Kebab-Case :
        - Examples of kebab case: first-name and last-name.

    [4] PascalCase : Most Popular Case                                
        - Examples of pascal case: FirstName and LastName.
