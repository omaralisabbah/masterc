    01 C Programming Language: 01 Introduction

    C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories in 1972.
    It is renowned for its efficiency, portability, and close relationship with the UNIX operating system,
    which it was initially designed to create.
    
    Language features:
    - High-Level Language with Low-Level Capabilities
    - Procedural Paradigm
    - Compiler-Based
    - Portability
    - Foundation for Other Languages

    
    Learning C offers several advantages:

    Deeper Understanding of Computer Architecture:
    C's low-level features provide insights into memory management, pointers, and hardware interaction.

    Efficiency and Performance:
    C allows for highly optimized code, making it suitable for performance-critical applications.

    Foundation for Advanced Topics:
    It serves as a stepping stone for learning other programming languages and advanced concepts like data structures and algorithms.

    System Programming Skills:
    C is essential for anyone interested in system-level programming, operating system development, or embedded systems.
