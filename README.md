# C Programming Language
🛠 Stage 1: Foundations

    Learn syntax basics: variables, data types, operators, control flow (if, switch, loops).

    Understand functions: declaration, definition, scope, return values.

    Practice with simple programs: calculators, number guessing games, basic string manipulation.

    Get comfortable with compilation: using gcc, debugging with gdb.

📚 Stage 2: Core Concepts

    Pointers and memory: pointer arithmetic, arrays, strings, dynamic memory (malloc, free).

    Structures and enums: modeling real-world data.

    File I/O: reading/writing text and binary files.

    Error handling: return codes, errno.

🚀 Stage 3: Intermediate Skills

    Modular programming: header files, separate compilation, libraries.

    Data structures: linked lists, stacks, queues, trees.

    Algorithms: sorting, searching, recursion.

    Memory management: avoiding leaks, using valgrind.

🧠 Stage 4: Advanced Mastery

    Low-level programming: bitwise operations, working with hardware registers.

    Concurrency: processes, threads (pthreads), synchronization.

    Networking: sockets, client-server models.

    Optimization: profiling, inline assembly, compiler flags.

🎯 Stage 5: Expert-Level Projects

    Build a text editor: like a mini version of nano.

    Implement a compiler or interpreter: for a toy language.

    Create an operating system kernel: minimal bootloader and task scheduler.

    Contribute to open-source C projects: Linux kernel, Git, SQLite.
