# C Programming Language

## 🛠 Stage 1: Foundations
- **[Learn syntax basics](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Learn%20syntax%20basics)**: variables, data types, operators, control flow (`if`, `switch`, loops).  
- **[Understand functions](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Understand%20functions)**: declaration, definition, scope, return values.  
- **[Practice with simple programs](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Practice%20with%20simple%20programs)**: calculators, number guessing games, basic string manipulation.  
- **[Get comfortable with compilation](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Get%20comfortable%20with%20compilation)**: using `gcc`, debugging with `gdb`.

## 📚 Stage 2: Core Concepts
- **[Pointers and memory](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Pointers%20and%20memory)**: pointer arithmetic, arrays, strings, dynamic memory (`malloc`, `free`).  
- **[Structures and enums](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Structures%20and%20enums)**: modeling real-world data.  
- **[File I/O](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20File%20I%2FO)**: reading/writing text and binary files.  
- **[Error handling](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Error%20handling)**: return codes, `errno`.

## 🚀 Stage 3: Intermediate Skills
- **[Modular programming](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Modular%20programming)**: header files, separate compilation, libraries.  
- **[Data structures](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Data%20structures)**: linked lists, stacks, queues, trees.  
- **[Algorithms](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Algorithms)**: sorting, searching, recursion.  
- **[Memory management](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Memory%20management)**: avoiding leaks, using `valgrind`.

## 🧠 Stage 4: Advanced Mastery
- **[Low-level programming](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Low-level%20programming)**: bitwise operations, working with hardware registers.  
- **[Concurrency](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Concurrency)**: processes, threads (`pthreads`), synchronization.  
- **[Networking](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Networking)**: sockets, client-server models.  
- **[Optimization](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Optimization)**: profiling, inline assembly, compiler flags.

## 🎯 Stage 5: Expert-Level Projects
- **[Build a text editor](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Build%20a%20text%20editor)**: like a mini version of `nano`.  
- **[Implement a compiler or interpreter](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Implement%20a%20compiler%20or%20interpreter)**: for a toy language.  
- **[Create an operating system kernel](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Create%20an%20operating%20system%20kernel)**: minimal bootloader and task scheduler.  
- **[Contribute to open-source C projects](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Contribute%20to%20open-source%20C%20projects)**: Linux kernel, Git, SQLite.
